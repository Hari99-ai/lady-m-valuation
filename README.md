## 🔎 Key Analysis  

### 1. Break-even Analysis  
- **Break-even Cakes per Year:** **23,625**  
- With Year One projected sales of **36,500 cakes**, Lady M comfortably surpasses break-even.  
- Indicates a feasible and profitable business model.  

### 2. Recommendation: WTC Expansion  
- **Year One Net Income:** $516,006  
- Profit margins projected to grow from **17.67% → 23.9%** (over five years).  
- While WTC has higher rent and operational risk, sensitivity analysis suggests expansion is **financially viable** if sales targets are met.  

### 3. Enterprise Value & Equity Stake  
Using the **Perpetuity Growth Method**:  
- PV of FCF (Years 1–5): **$2,617,960**  
- PV of Terminal Value: **$75,420,773**  
- **Enterprise Value (EV): $78,038,733**  
- PV of TV as % of EV: **96.7%**  

➡️ Equity for Chinese investors should be **proportional to their investment relative to EV** to avoid over-dilution.  

### 4. Baseline Assumptions Evaluation  
- **Assumptions:**  
  - 10% annual cake growth  
  - 50% COGS  
  - 5% labor escalation  
  - 3% rent/utilities escalation  

- These are reasonable, but **10% cake sales growth may be optimistic**. External factors like brand recognition, tourist footfall, and market conditions must be tracked.  

### 5. Chinese Investors’ Offer  
- Recommended to **accept the offer** if equity aligns with EV.  
- Provides **capital for WTC expansion** without significant dilution.  
- Safeguard needed: **management retains strategic decision-making authority**.
